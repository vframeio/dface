It uses client-side neural network face detection to locate faces, which are then redacted or blurred using various effects. Photos processed using DFACE are never transmitted, shared, stored, or analyzed by DFACE. All the processing happens on your device. This means you can use DFACE privately, even offline, to redact your photos.</p><p>VFRAME also provides a command line computer vision tool for redacting faces in large collections of media. Visit<!-- --> <a href="https://vframe.io/">VFRAME</a> to learn more about what VFRAME does.</p><p>This preliminary guide will continue to be updated as the DFACE project develops further. It is currently formatted to address the most common concerns relating to face recognition and the security or privacy of images shared online.</p><h2 class="pageTitle" id="intro">Introduction</h2><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Why Redact Faces?</h3><p>The Internet is a place for sharing, but also a place for large scale mass surveillance. Sharing photos with a global community on the Internet now carries the risk that any face appearing in a photo may be subjected to facial recognition searches. Even in an area as small as 100x100 pixels, your face may be recognizable. The extent to which your face is unique and recognizable across a population is dependent on several factors including the relative accuracy of the face recognition technology used, the dataset it was trained on, your relative uniqueness amongst a population, the quality of the image you appear in, whether you are wearing any facial coverings, and the similarity between your query and a target image which diverges with age. Obscuring your face can degrade the performance of most face recognition systems, but it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of a disguise, blocking accessory, or anti-surveillance tactic without prior knowledge of the face recognition algorithm architecture. Therefore, the recommended approach to limit biometric markers (i.e. faces) in imagery is redaction.</p><p>This site provides a set of tools to fully redact faces, using rectangles to block out parts of image, and other blurring and modification tools to reduce the unique separability of biometric information. Whether you want to block out, blur, or pixellate the face is a subjective decision made by you, the user, and depends on your privacy and security circumstances.</p><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Why Use DFACE?</h3><p>DFACE is an open source web application that uses client-side face detection so that your photos never leave your device. Other, similarily intentioned, web applications found during research were flawed in some way. Many used server side processing, which requires sharing/uploading your image to an online service. Some did not work well at detecting faces real world imagery - that is, they were mostly designed for use with webcam interaction. Some sites even charged money. In addition to the privacy risks of server side processing that requires uploading your photos to an unknown third party, it also adds network latency, uses unnecessary bandwidth for each upload, and (of course) only works when you&#x27;re online.</p><p>DFACE addresses these issues by running everything on your device. You will need to first download the application, which requires approximately 13MB of bandwidth. The files are then cached and available for use offline. You can run the model on hundreds or thousands of images with no network latency, completely offline, without requiring any specialized hardware beyond a laptop or smart phone. DFACE is completely free to use.</p><h2 class="pageTitle" id="redactions">Redactions</h2><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Faces</h3><p>The main purpose of DFACE is to detect and redact faces using various effects. DFACE can detect up to 1,000 faces in an image. Faces smaller than 10x10 pixels will likely not be detected. At such low resolution, it is not possible to uniquely identify someone using only their face against a large database. However, there is still enough information at 10x10 pixels to estimate skin and hair color, reducing the size of a face search space. This means it would be possible to know the difference between one person with darker skin and one person with lighter skin, or one person with lighter hair and one person with darker hair. Visible faces larger than 10x10 pixels should always be automatically detected and redacted by DFACE.</p><p>In addition to blocking out parts of an image, DFACE allows covering the detected face with emojis. Prior to adding emojis, the facial areas are blurred. This prevents the irregular emoji shapes from inadvertently revealing portions of a face.</p><h3 class="pageSubTitle">EXIF Data</h3><p>EXIF data is automatically discarded during processing.</p><h2 class="pageTitle" id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Logos and Identifiiable Clothing</h3><p>Please be aware that DFACE does not address the issue of other uniquely identifiiable information appearing in your photo, which may include logos, clothing, locations, tattoos, or other environmental visual elements. DFACE is only designed to redact faces. In the future we will provide a manual drawing tool to redact other portions of an image.</p><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Device Signature Analysis</h3><p>Please be aware that DFACE does not address the issue of device signature analysis. Device signature analysis invovles exploiting the small diferrences in sensors, hardware, and compression algorithms to determine the make and model of a phone or camera used to create a photo. This is known to provide the ability to tell the difference between hundreds of different phones. DFACE does not yet provide any tools to address device signature analysis.</p><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Non-Face Biometric Markers</h3><p>Please be aware that DFACE does not address the issue of biometric markers other than faces. Non-face biometric markers include hand size, foot size, height, arm length, skin abberations (freckles), or hair descriptors. Any part of a body visible in an image may be forensically analyzed using other reference markers to determine or estimate details about these attributes, which may reveal identity information.</p><h2 class="pageTitle" id="other-software">Other Software</h2><h3 class="pageSubTitle">Signal</h3><p>DFACE recommends using<!-- --> <a href="https://www.signal.org/" target="blank">Signal</a> <!-- -->for on-device face blurring when faces are simple to detect. Signal is free, private, secure, and works reasonably well. DFACE provides some additional tools not found in Signal including multi-file processing, significantly improved detection performance, emojis, and is also platform agnostic.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/guide","query":{},"buildId":"SGRGoOMqIHnziBtt6tSJ_","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
