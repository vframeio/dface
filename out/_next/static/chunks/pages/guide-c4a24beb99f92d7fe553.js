Sharing photos with a global community on the Internet now carries the risk that any face appearing in a photo may be subjected to facial recognition searches. Even in an area as small as 100x100 pixels, your face may be recognizable. The extent to which your face is unique and recognizable across a population is dependent on several factors including the relative accuracy of the face recognition technology used, the dataset it was trained on, your relative uniqueness amongst a population, the quality of the image you appear in, whether you are wearing any facial coverings, and the similarity between your query and a target image which diverges with age. Obscuring your face can degrade the performance of most face recognition systems, but it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of a disguise, blocking accessory, or anti-surveillance tactic without prior knowledge of the face recognition algorithm architecture. Therefore, the recommended approach to limit biometric markers (i.e. faces) in imagery is redaction."}),(0,t.tZ)("p",{children:"This site provides a set of tools to fully redact faces, using rectangles to block out parts of image, and other blurring and modification tools to reduce the unique separability of biometric information.

DFACE can detect up to 1,000 faces in an image. Faces smaller than 10x10 pixels will likely not be detected. At such low resolution, it is not possible to uniquely identify someone using only their face against a large database. However, there is still enough information at 10x10 pixels to estimate skin and hair color, reducing the size of a face search space.
