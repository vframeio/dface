# DFACE.app

[DFACE.app](https://dface.app) is a web application that performs high quality face redaction in a web browser using YOLOv5 computer vision models and Tensorflow.js. Made by VFRAME.io.



## Environment Setup

- Install NVM from https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

```bash
nvm use node
nvm install 14.17.1
nvm use 14.17.1
```

- Install Yarn

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

- Disable Next.js telemetry:

```bash
npx next telemetry disable
```

## Development

Start a development server on http://localhost:3000/

```bash
yarn dev
```

Models should be placed in `public/assets/models/` in folders named identically to the names in `modelzoo.yaml`. The application will look for the file `model.json` when loading a model. The active models can be rebuilt from the YAML by running:

```bash
yarn modelzoo
```

### Emoji

Let's admit it, emoji are probably the most important part of this application. Here is how you can generate a test document of emoji so you can load more (using twemoji):

```bash
cd node_modules/twemoji-emojis/vendor/svg
echo "<style>div img { width: 48px; height: 48px; display: block; } div { display: inline-block; font-size: 12px; }</style>" >> emoji.html
for i in *.svg; do echo "<div><img src="$i">$i</div>" >> emoji.html; done
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

- Navigate to http://localhost:8000/emoji.html
- Emoji are listed in `components/common/Emoji.js`, follow the pattern to add new ones
- Emoji are grouped by classes. The list of classes should correspond to the emojiOptions in `constants/index.js`

## Deployment

This command will build the static site to the `out/` directory, suitable for deployment.

```bash
yarn build
```
